SCC-DFTB program
started on 19th of august of 2011 at 01:39 am. Bremen, Germany, by MPL.
The first h2o calculations happened on 15th of November 2011 at 15:21 pm.
The first h2o cluster calculation with 60 waters happened on 26th of November 2011 at 17:41 pm.
The first h2o cluster calculation with 141 waters happened on 26th of November 2011 at 17:10 pm.
All the Slater-Koster transformation implementations, those involving d orbitals, was finished on 25th of February 2012.

The basic DFTB standard finished at 23rd of April 2012 in Brazil where several single points DFTB calculations
of CNT's were performed with up to 400 atoms.

The SCC-DFTB implementation finished on 6th of August 2012 at 21:53. Betim, Brazil.
After a week of trying to guess the problem, I observed that the problem is the definition of Delta_q, which has the
opposite signal as defined in the SCC papers.

# 10/05/2014
This version (1.0.1) is the one with the MVC archtectural style from the version 1.0.0:
/home/maicon/workspace/py-DFTB.1.0.0

# Also, on 06/08/2014 I modified the module diag.py
# to start to use scipy to do the generalized diagonalization.
# As a result, we improved the performance in about 60%
# compared to using f2py and shared objects.
# Also, the scc_procedure.py was also slight modified 
# since I saw that it was doing the same diagonalization
# twice (I do not know why). But, I fixed it!

This is the version to work hereafter.
