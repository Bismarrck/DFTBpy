Installing:

1- You need to have installed:
python 2.7 or newer 2.x.
gcc compiler.
numpy and scipy.

2- To install DFTBpy just do in the main DFTBpy folder:

python setup.py build

3) Got to the examples folder and then edit the run_dftb.sh file:

$HOME/DFTBpy/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/src/dftbpy

4) As the input template ('inp.dftb') is there with the SLAKOs path, execute:

./run_dftb.sh
or
sh run_dftb.sh

5) That's it... Enjoy!!!
